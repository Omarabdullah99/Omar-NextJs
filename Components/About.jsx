          Hello, Itâ€™s me Omar Abdullah. I have completed my diploma degree in Computer Technology from Khulna Polytechnic Institute. I am a Full-stack developer. I have knowledge about frontend and backend technology to build responsive modern and dynamic websites. <br /> <br />

          On the front-end side, I am specialized in HTML, CSS, tailwind, bootstrap, and JavaScript frameworks such as React. I can create user friendly web applications. <br /> <br />

         Moving to the backend, I specialize in backend web development using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose. This tech stack allows me to build the server-side of web applications, handle data storage, and create robust APIs for various web and mobile projects. <br /> <br />

        I have done several projects like e-commerce, blog, and quiz web applications using React, CSS, Tailwind CSS, React Router DOM, Express.js, NoSQL databases like MongoDB, and authentication with Mongoose.
